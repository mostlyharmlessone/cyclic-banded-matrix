# Using cyclic-banded securely

As far as any numerical Fortran code is concerned, inappropriate input to the algorithm may cause an exception and theoretically cause a security breach.  While there are some checks of the sanity of the input with error code handling, there are no checks on memory allocation or size of the problem.  Anyone wishing to add this functionality to the code is welcome.
