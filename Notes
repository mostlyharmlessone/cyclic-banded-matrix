Notes on the 2023 update.

Since 2021 there has been some code clean up, with one or two bug fixes.  

All but the matrix solution and error reporting LAPACK has been commented out and replaced with intrinsic matmul operations; the compiler can decide to use lapack or not. :)  One issue found was that one of the DGEMM calls violated the following:
!  DGEMM argument B (UE and B)
!  https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~merz/intel_f10b/main_for/mergedProjects/optaps_for/fortran/optaps_prg_arrs_f.htm
!  assumed-shape array or array pointer to an explicit-shape array can slow run-time performance. 
!  This is because the compiler needs to create an array temporary for the entire array. 
!  The array temporary is created because the passed array may not be contiguous 
!  and the receiving (explicit-shape) array requires a contiguous array.

A new routine with 4 way parallelism has been added for the general case, it is documented in band_matrix.pdf

A Cmake file is now included.
